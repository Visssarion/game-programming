# Math
Not really a design pattern.
This chapter contains short explanations of different mathematical concepts.

Currently its not a long explanation, but more of a starting point to learn certain concepts.

# Using

I will be explaining some of the math through actual math formulas. However, in practice, all of these are already functions and mathods available in your development enviroment. You don't need to memorize them, just be aware that they exist.
