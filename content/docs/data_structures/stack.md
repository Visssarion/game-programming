Stack is a linear data structure. It follows the order of First In Last Out (FILO). It means that the first element that entered stack, will exit the last.

Easiest allegory to explain a stack is to use a stack of plates. When you put a new plate on the stack, you are able to take off the ones underneath it, only if you take off the top one.

In enviroments without implementations of Stack specific methods, a linear Array can be used. In this case, you will can only use methods that interract with the tail end of the array (`pop_back`, `pop_front`).
